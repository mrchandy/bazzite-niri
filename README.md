## Do Not Use 

This is an image I'm using to learn more about bootc, and things can and will break. It is also my starting point into using Github/git.

To get this to a more stable state I'm considering moving to stable releases of niri/dms/qs instead of git releases.

## Goals

My objective is to combine the gaming comforts of [Bazzite](https://github.com/ublue-os/bazzite), and the work [Zirconium](https://github.com/zirconium-dev/zirconium) is doing of applying Niri into bootc.

Many thanks to Bazzite, and Zirconium. Without your work I wouldn't be here. Particularly Tulip, and Valerie.
