## Do Not Use 

This is an image I'm using to learn more about bootc, and things can and will break. It is also my starting point into using Github/git.

## Goals

My objective is to combine the gaming comforts of [Bazzite](https://github.com/ublue-os/bazzite), and the work [Zirconium](https://github.com/zirconium-dev/zirconium) is doing of applying Niri into bootc.

I have a working image so far, but I think I made some initial mistakes when I had no clue what Bazzites build process was like and have some ideas to make maintaining with upstream without messing up my own workflow much easier.
